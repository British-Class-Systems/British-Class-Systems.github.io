                    <b>History of housing and the class system</b><br><br>

                    Previously, a person's social class had a big impact on the type of house they had. Those at the
                    bottom of the social classes sometimes couldn’t afford a house and would live in a slum with lots of
                    other people. They wouldn’t have beds or anywhere to wash as they couldn’t afford it or were
                    unemployed and considered at the bottom of the class system.<br><br>

                    At the opposite end of the scale, the upper classes would live in large houses with lots of spare
                    bedrooms and have maids to clean and cook for them.<br><br>

                    <b>Modern day housing and the class system</b><br><br>

                    Even today, a person’s class can have a big impact on the type of house they live in. There are
                    still lots of homeless people at the bottom end of the class system, although there are some
                    homeless shelters where they can stay a night and get some food.<br><br>

                    Working class people can’t normally afford to rent expensive houses or to buy their own home, so
                    they live in social housing, and even then they sometimes have to travel far from where they grew up
                    or wanted to live to be able to get a house. The houses can also be very bad and have problems that
                    make people ill, and in the worst cases, even die. <br><br>

                    Middle class people can still struggle to buy their own home, but they can normally afford more
                    expensive rent and live in nicer houses. They normally have a bedroom to themselves, unlike with
                    social housing. If they are lucky they might have their own home, but it will still have a mortgage,
                    so it’s not really theirs.<br><br>

                    Upper class people can normally afford to have a nice house that doesn’t have a mortgage and that
                    has extras that other people want, like garages and some even have swimming pools. These houses are
                    large and can include mansions.<br><br>
