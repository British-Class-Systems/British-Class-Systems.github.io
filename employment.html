                            <br>

                            When the class system was first introduced, it was hard for people to move from one social class to another. This meant the jobs people did were decided by the class they were born into. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            People who were at the bottom of the class system were labourers, and those in the middle of the class system were farmers and businessmen. People at the top of the class system didn’t have to work.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Modern day employment and the class system</b> <br>
                            Now, people can move through the social classes. This means people should be able to get any job no matter what their social class is, but it still doesn’t always happen like that. Certain classes, and people who can go to university, still normally get the more upper class jobs. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Working class jobs are common jobs and are very easy to get jobs, all you need is to be fit enough and be healthy. Most working class jobs are physical jobs, such as working in a warehouse, or retail and clerical jobs, such as working in a shop.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Middle class jobs are slightly more difficult to get as you normally need to have passed some of your GCSEs, and even university. Middle class jobs include teachers, lawyers, doctors and many more.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Upper class jobs are normally the most well paid and are well respected. You will normally need lots of GCSEs and to have got higher university qualifications. These are very advanced jobs and normally have a lot of stress. Upper class jobs include senior civil servants, aerospace engineers, barristers and judges, and many more.
